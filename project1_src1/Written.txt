You have an array of vertices. What would you need to do to produce an object representation using vertex indices?  How would the original array change?  What
additional data structures would you need?

Answer
---------

The original vertex array would not need to change. You can simply have an array of indices representing the vertices of the polygon if it were drawn
using GL_LINE_LOOP or GL_POLYGON. Alternatively you could create the index array such that it is in GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP/FAN format as well.

You want 3 views of the same scene, each taking up 1/4 of the screen. These three views should show the front, side and top views of the object. Describe in words
what needs to be done with the viewport and camera to accomplish this. How does this affect the viewing frustum?

Answer
---------

glViewPort() can be used to set which part of the screen to project the object. This allows 3 views of the same scene on the screen simultaneously. To get the
different views you would need to rotate the camera (possibly translate before rotation) with glRotate() to view the different sides of the object. Assuming you
want the same perspective for each view, the viewing frustum shouldn't change.
